         <p class="CenterGridBCD Text3">Raids groups are a way to have parties of more than 5 and up to 40 people, divided into up to 8 groups of up to 5 players. The terms "raid" and "raiding" primarily and traditionally refer to PvE raid-specific instances. Raid instances require playing as a team, and are designed to be the most challenging and entertaining PvE content available in the game. There are three different difficulties of raiding, Normal, Heroic and Mythic, not to be confused with <a class="Linkthing" href="index3.html">Mythic+</a>. Raiding in WoW can be hard, especially on Mythic difficulty</p>
